# Notescli

This is a helper for me when I'm working away and want to quickly load up my
notes files.

## Development

There are npm scripts to do the common things. (Use/extend these + document) 

```
$ npm run-script [script]

    build   Compile Typescript in 'src' into JavaScript in 'dist'
    watch   Compile Typescript in `watch` mode (for development)
    clean   RimRaf the 'dist' folder, great before a rebuild

    test    Run any tests (via 'jest')
    lint    Run 'eslint' and 'prettier'
    format  Run `prettier --write` on pretty much everything
```
